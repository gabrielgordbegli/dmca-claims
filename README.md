Feel free to add other companies and their forms to this list.
1. Download company's logo as an SVG from their Wikipedia Page.
2. Place the file in 'public/logos'.
3. Add a LogoContainer component with a url prop to the index.js file (alphabetical order).
4. User account info is saved making it easier for them to auto fill forms from the same or different sites
5. User user can see their pending claims
6. The site will automatically fill out the forms using xml requests I think, or I can just do it manually for now and then get rob on board to help with that shit or something
